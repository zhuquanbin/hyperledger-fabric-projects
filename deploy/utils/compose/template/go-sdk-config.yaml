        # PreferOrg:
        #   Determines which peers are suitable based on block height lag threshold, although will prefer the peers in the
        #   current org (as long as their block height is above a configured threshold). If none of the peers from the current org
        #   are suitable then a peer from another org is chosen.
        # MinBlockHeight:
        #   Chooses the best peer according to a block height lag threshold. The maximum block height of all peers is
        #   determined and the peers whose block heights are under the maximum height but above a provided "lag" threshold are load
        #   balanced. The other peers are not considered.

        # [Optional] blockHeightLagThreshold sets the block height lag threshold. This value is used for choosing a peer

        # blocks then it will be excluded from selection.

        # Default: 5
        blockHeightLagThreshold: 2

        # [Optional] reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold - the event client will disconnect from the peer if the peer's
        # block height falls behind the specified number of blocks and will reconnect to a better performing peer.
        # Note that this parameter is only applicable if peerMonitor is set to Enabled (default).
        # Default: 10
        # NOTES:

        #     affecting performance.
        reconnectBlockHeightLagThreshold: 5
